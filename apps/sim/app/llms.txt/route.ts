> Sim is the open-source AI workspace where teams build, deploy, and manage AI agents. Connect 1,000+ integrations and every major LLM to create agents that automate real work.

Sim lets teams create agents visually with the workflow builder, conversationally through Chat, or programmatically with the API. The workspace includes knowledge bases, tables, files, and full observability.
